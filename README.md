### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Ailin Wang!
#### I am an enthusiast who loves to explore the latest models and technologies in the field of data science and deep learning. I have a huge interest in NLP and various forms of attention-based models (e.g., TransFormer, Auto-Regressive Models, FastFormer...).
#### Exploratory Data Analysis | Predictive Analytics | MLOps | Attention-based Models
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently a graduate student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo. I have a Master's Degree in the field of Multidisciplinary Sciences and a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry, and I would like to apply my skills to solve both life science-related and real-world problems.
Statistical methods such as machine learning and neural networks have shown great potential in many chemical and biological applications such as virtual screening and molecular property prediction, and I would like to explore the potential of the latest models and technologies in applications such as 
Molecular Property Prediction and Automated Molecule Generation. Furthermore, I would like to learn more about MLOps for continuous delivery and automation pipelines in solving real-world problems in data-driving approaches!
