#### I am an enthusiast who loves to explore the latest models and technologies in the field of data science and deep learning. I have a huge interest in NLP and various forms of attention-based models (e.g., TransFormer, Auto-Regressive Models, FastFormer...).
#### Exploratory Data Analysis | Predictive Analytics | MLOps | Attention-based Models
- üå± I'm currently a graduate student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo. I have a Master's Degree in the field of Multidisciplinary Sciences and a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry, and I would like to apply my skills to solve both Life Science related and Real-World problems.
- üî¨ Statistical methods such as machine learning and neural networks have shown great potential in many chemical and biological applications such as virtual screening and molecular property prediction, and I would like to explore the potential of the latest models and technologies in applications such as 
Molecular Property Prediction and Automated Molecule Generation.
- ü§ì Furthermore, I would like to learn more about MLOps for continuous delivery and automation pipelines in solving real-world problems in data-driven approaches!

#### I am also interested in a variety of topics ranging from Fintech, Defi to Philosophy, Philosophy of Technology, and I am always passionate about building a wide range of knowledge bases and using that to help humanity towards Prosperity, Sustainability, Diversity, and Inclusion.
- üå± My first project started when I was in my last year at university doing research about Intermolecular Potential Energy. There I was able to use a variety of Python packages to crawl Z-matrix (coordinate representation of atoms) into an SQL database.
Then I was also fascinated by the potential of data visualization and it helped propel my research.
- üöÄ I have experimented with DQN on Bitcoin price for its ability on time series prediction and I would like to learn more about Reinforcement learning.
- üìö My recent reading list includes _What Begins After the End of the Enlightenment?_ by Yuk Hui, _Correspondences_ by Tim Ingold , _Can the Monster Speak?_ by Paul Preciado
- üñºÔ∏è I'm currently experimenting with Stable Fiffusion and ControlNet for AI-assisted Art
